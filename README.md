# Bayesian Deep Learning for BI-RADS Prediction

This repository contains the implementation code for the manuscript:

**"BI-RADS prediction of mammographic masses using uncertainty information extracted from a Bayesian Deep Learning model "**

---

## Overview
This code implements a Bayesian deep learning model for BI-RADS classification from mammography images by incorporating uncertainty information, using TensorFlow and Keras.  
The model incorporates uncertainty estimation to improve reliability and interpretability.
